- As someone who uses Google Places/maps for business and running errands, I want an app where I could keep track of my sightseeing.
- As someone who has sudden thoughts about great places I want to go to but then forgets about them, I want an app where I can record them without much of a hastle.
-I like to post my travel apps to social media but don't have time to sort and filter through them right away. I want a place where I can just store them all right away and then send some over to social media channels when I have more time to filter them.
I don't like to travel alone. I want an app where I can see what location my friends want to travel t so we can plan a trip together. 
The bookmarks on my Google Maps are mostly boring errand related places like my dentist's location and my workplace. I want an app specifically made for the Indiana Jones in me. 
-  As a person frustrated with everyone asking for my personal info, I want an App that DOESNT have a login.
